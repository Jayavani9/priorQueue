Priority Queue can be used as a Min Heap as well as Max Heap.

In a Min Heap, the queue stores elements in an ascending order. It means when we pop the element out of the min heap, it is always a smaller element that comes out.

In a Man Heap, the queue stores elements in descending order, it means when we pop the element out of max heap, it is always a greater element that comes out.

We can modify a priority Queue as per the requirement. We can make it work as either a Min Heap or a Max Heap.
